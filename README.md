# Communify


## Inspiration
More often than not the best academics tend to be from a language most under privileged children do not speak.

## What it does
We eliminate the need to constantly have to translate instant messages to and from another language which gets tedious while texting

## How we built it
We used the deep translator API to instantly translate text into the users selected language and to convey messages from the user to the other party in their native language.

## Challenges we ran into
We could not complete the process of linking the front end to the back end within the given time

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully managed to use the API to convert text from one language to another and vice versa. We also used SQL to securely store user data such as their preferred language.

## What we learned
How to build a texting app from scratch with external API's to implement additional functionality.

## What's next for COMMUNIFY
We hope to connect our users who have similar interests with each other in an attempt to create a global community without barriers.
